Surface to Segmentation regions:

I want you to divide this projection surface into 5 disjunct areas that are each spatially confined to a region of the frame. Your goal is to generate an image: a segmentation map with 5 disjunct regions (all white on a black background), where each white area is self-contained, not connected to any other white region and maps onto a particular part of the actual projection surface. Prefer regions that have brighter colors and less texture when possible since those produce clearer visuals with more contrast when projected on. I will then take your generated segmentation map and use each white region to create surface mapped VJ content inside each white region and project it onto the building. Make sure the generated output image has the exact same aspect ratio as the input image so I can overlay it on top. Output image should only contain large, white regions on a black background, no colors, no numbers, no text
